The idea was to make recommendation for required topics better than the YouTube recommendation. So to achieve this I started collecting different search results by using search().list() and using that data I retrieved the statistics(View Count, Like Count, Dislike Count, Favourite Count), Duration and Published At for the corresponding search results by passing the Video ID as argument to videos().list().
